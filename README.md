# jslists
A library for creating and managing dynamic collapsible lists

When a recent project required a tree view for displaying MI data, I wanted to use a basic HTML list setup.
After a quick trawl, there are either heavy weight libraries like JSTREE which have a dependancy on jQuery or very light weight libraries that didn't really give me what I needed.

So, I sat down and penned the following little library! It's lightweight enough right now. Will have a good deal of functionality (given time).

So far I have a tree generator. I will also release as part of a fuller package a library that will generate the HTML lists from either JSON or array data.
